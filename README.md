# Swagger Doclet 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/teamcarma/swagger-jaxrs-doclet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/teamcarma/swagger-jaxrs-doclet)

This is a JavaDoc Doclet that can be used to generate a JSON Swagger resource listing suitable for feeding to the Swagger UI. It generates the resource listing from the source code of java JAXRS resources and entities.

This was originally forked from [Ryan Kennedy's original doclet](https://github.com/ryankennedy/swagger-jaxrs-doclet) to add support for swagger 1.2 and has moved on considerably from it.

This is used as a basis for the [Carma API Reference](https://api-dev.car.ma/apidoc/ref/index.html) which is a good working example of the Swagger UI being used for a large API.

#####Note you can win [$1,000,000](http://carmacarpool.com/prize) using the Carma API! 


##Why Use This Doclet?

+ As the JSON resource listing  is generated offline from source code it means that you do not need to add any runtime dependencies to your project and avoid potential headaches with different jar versions and jaxrs implementations. This also avoids increasing the size of your artifacts. 
+ The offline approach also allows you to post process the JSON if you wish. 
+ You also do not need to add any Swagger specific annotations to your source code as you can fine tune the generated documentation using javadoc tags.

```

### Gradle

Here is an example build.gradle file that will generate the swagger JSON files in the build/reports/rest-api-docs directory:

```

 apply plugin: 'java'

 configurations {
   doclet
 }

 repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
 } 

dependencies {
    doclet(
        [group: 'com.carma', name: 'swagger-doclet', version: '1.0.5'],
        [group: 'javax.ws.rs', name: 'javax.ws.rs-api', version: '2.0']
    ) 
}

 task generateRestApiDocs(type: Javadoc) {
   source = sourceSets.main.allJava
   destinationDir = reporting.file("rest-api-docs")
   options.classpath = configurations.doclet.files.asType(List)
   options.docletpath = configurations.doclet.files.asType(List)
   options.doclet = "com.carma.swagger.doclet.ServiceDoclet"
   options.addStringOption("apiVersion", "1")
   options.addStringOption("docBasePath", "/sps/apidocs")
   options.addStringOption("apiBasePath", "/sps")
   options.addBooleanOption("skipUiFiles", true)
}
```

#### Including Model Classes from outside the doclet project
Thanks to @nkoterba for these gradle instructions described in issue 82.
There are two solutions:

**Solution 1**
For those **not** using Intelli-J, you can just define a sourceset that points to the source of your current project where the Doclet plugin is run + any Model projects:

```
sourceSets {
    doclet {
        java {
            srcDir 'src/main/java'
            // List all the source project directories where we define
            // Models that will be used by Doclet to generate REST API Docs
            srcDir project(":code:models:api").file("src/main/java")
        }
    }
}
```

Then update your task that generates the REST API Docs from:
```
source = sourceSets.main.allJava
```

to:
```
source = sourceSets.doclet.allJava
```

**Solution 2**
Unfortunately, if you are using Intelli-J, it's Gradle Sync/Plugin will complain if you define a SourceSet with sources outside of your project. See: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-122577#tab=Comments

So instead, you have to "manually" build your source set:

```
task generateRestApiDocs(type: Javadoc) {
    // Ideally would use a custom-defined source set above
    // However, Intelli-J can't handle Sources out of content root
    // See: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-122577#tab=Comments
    // and: https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/70
    // So instead "manually" creating the source set

    def sourceList = new ArrayList<File>()

    sourceList.addAll(sourceSets.main.allJava);
    project(":code:models:api").fileTree("src/main/java").each {
        sourceList.add(it)
    }

    source = sourceList
    options.classpath = configurations.doclet.files.asType(List)
    options.docletpath = configurations.doclet.files.asType(List)

   // ... Rest of doclet setup/configuration here
   
```

### Usage Notes
The settings that you use for the doc base path and the api base path will vary depending on both the version of swagger that is used and the name used for your top level resource listing. Please refer to the Doclet Options section of this document for a detailed description of these. 

The doclet will generate a service.json file which is the swagger spec 1.2 resource listing and will also generate a series of resource json files. To use the swagger ui with the generated json files you can either use the swagger ui that is embedded with this doclet (currently 2.1.8-M1) or use your own which is recommended for most people as it allows you to tweak the look and feel.


You would then add various javadoc tags to your source code to fine tune the generated documentation.
The generated documentation will be written as a series of JSON files in a format that the Swagger UI can read. You would typically deploy the Swagger UI and your API JSON files on a webserver.

To see a working example of the generated documentation refer to the [example](#example) below.

NOTE: If you use your own copy of the swagger ui then you will need to modify the index.html so that the url points not to the swagger petstore example but to the service.json file generated by this doclet.
For example if the service.json is in a dir called apidocs then the change to index.html would look like this:

```
window.swaggerUi = new SwaggerUi({
      url: "apidocs/service.json"
```

Note: If you are using a snapshot version then these are deployed in the sonatype snapshots repository so you will either need to checkout the snapshot version and run mvn install on it or you will need to include the Sonatype Nexus Snapshots repository. For Maven you can put the following in either in your settings.xml or pom.xml.

```
<repositories>
...
		<repository>
			<id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
			<name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>
			<url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
			<releases>
				<enabled>false</enabled>
			</releases>
			<snapshots>
				<enabled>true</enabled>
			</snapshots>
		</repository>
		...
	</repositories>

## Supported Javadoc Tags and Annotations

<table>
	<tr><th>Tag</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Applies To</th><th>Aliases</th></tr>
	<tr><td>@exclude</td><td>Use to exclude a resource class, operation, model field or method from the generated documentation</td><td>classes, operations, model methods & fields</td><td>@hidden, @hide</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@excludeParams</td><td>Use to exclude operation parameters from the generated documentation</td><td>operations</td><td>@hiddenParams, @hideParams</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@responseMessage</td><td>Use to describe each success or response status returned from an operation. It is made up of a numeric status code, a description an an optional response model specifically for this error.<br><br>For example:<br><br>
	@responseMessage 404 not found<br><br>
	@responseMessage 404 not found `fixtures.responsemessages.Response1<br><br>
	NOTE: The optional response model class is added after a backtick as in the example above.
	NOTE 2: By default the response messages are ordered in ascending order of response code so success codes come before error codes. You can change this using the responseMessageSortMode doclet option described below.
	</td><td>operations</td><td>@status, @errorResponse, @successResponse, @errorCode, @successCode</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@responseType</td><td><p>If you want the documented response model class to be different to the one in the java method signature you can use this to override it. This is useful to replace the Jax Rs response class with a particular entity type that may be returned. For example:</p>
	<p>
	<code><pre>
	/**
	 * @responseType fixtures.responsemodel.Response2
	 */
	@SuppressWarnings("javadoc")
	@GET 
	public Response responseDefinedViaTag() {
		return Response.ok().entity(new Response2()).build();
	}
	</pre></code></p><p>In the above method the response model documented will be fixtures.responsemodel.Response2.</p>
	<p><i>NOTE: if the response class is not in the same maven project as the one the doclet plugin is on then you will need to include the response class in the source of your project. One way to do this in maven is to use the maven-dependency-plugin's unpack goal to unpack the *.java files of the dependency source jar to a temporary directory such as ${project.build.directory}/additional-sources and then attach that directory to your project source using the build-helper-maven-plugin's add-source goal.</i></p>
	<p>You can also use collections both of entities:</p>
	<p><code><pre>
	@responseType&nbsp;java.util.List&lt;fixtures.responsemodel.Response2&gt;	</pre>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>and primitives:</p>

	@responseType&nbsp;java.util.List&lt;java.lang.String&gt;
	</pre>
	</code>
	</p>

	</td><td>operations</td><td>@outputType, @returnType</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@inputType</td><td>If you want to have a different class type used as the model for a body parameter then you can use this. For example:

	 */
	@POST
	@Path("/postData2b")
	public Response postData2b(@HeaderParam("X-forwarded-for") String xFwd, @QueryParam("p1") int p1, Data1 data) {

	<tr><td>@paramsDefaultValue</td><td>Defines the default value for one or more of the parameters of an operation. This uses a format of space separated name and value pairs e.g.  param1Name param1DefaultValue param2Name param2DefaultValue. This doclet also supports reading default values from the JAXRS DefaultValue annotation which takes precedence over this for a given parameter. For enums a default value must be one of the enum values, for numeric types if there is a minimum value then a default value must be >= to it, similarly if there is a maximum value then a default value must be <= to it. NOTE: The values for the name of the parameter in this CSV must be the raw name in the method signature/bean param field not the name as derived via an annotation or javadoc tag.</td><td>operations</td><td>@defaultValues</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>@paramsAllowableValues</td><td>Defines the allowable values for one or more of the parameters of an operation. This uses a format of space separated name and value pairs e.g.  param1Name param1AllowableValue1 param1Name param1AllowableValue2 param2Name param2AllowableValue1 etc. A default value must be one of these allowable values. NOTE: The values for the name of the parameter in this CSV must be the raw name in the method signature/bean param field not the name as derived via an annotation or javadoc tag.</td><td>operations</td><td>@allowableValues</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>@paramsNameValue</td><td>Defines custom names for one or more of the parameters of an operation.

	<tr><td>@resourcePath</td><td>This sets the path for resources in the resource listing e.g. the service.json file. This does NOT impact the api path which is soley controlled via the @Path annotations. You should put this tag on either a) the resource class if using a single resource class per api resource, or b) one of the operation methods of each resource if you have endpoints from multiple resources in the same class file. NOTE if you have resource classes with empty paths or a path that is / then by default these classes will be give the resource path of /root, if you put @resourcePath on the class this will be used instead of /root. You can also use the doclet parameter -resourcePath to customize the resource path for root resources.</td><td>operations, resource classes</td><td>@resource,@parentEndpointName</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>@resourceDescription</td><td>This sets the description for an operation in the resource listing e.g. the service.json file.

	<tr><td>@resourcePriority</td><td>This sets a priority for ordering resources in the resource listing e.g. the service.json file. They are ordered in ascending order of priority provided the doclet option -sortResourcesByPriority is set. You should put this tag on either the resource class, if using a single resource class per api resource, or one of the operation methods of each resource, if you have endpoints from multiple resources in the same class file. NOTE this will only take effect if the swagger ui apisSorter option is "none" in the index.html of the swagger ui, this is NOT the case in the embedded swagger ui.</td><td>operations, resource classes</td><td>@resourceOrder</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>@unauthorized</td><td>Indicates a method does NOT require authentication, in this case an empty authorizations field will be added to the operation json e.g. authorizations": { } The swagger 1.2 spec indicates this overrides authentication at the api level however in practice it appears that not adding this vs adding empty authorizations has the same effect in Swagger UI.</td><td>operations</td><td>@noAuth</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@scope</td><td>Indicates this method requires authorization and in particular the calling user must have this scope. Multiple scopes can be added using multiple tags. The scopes defined on the operation level must be one of the scopes in the Authorizations section of the service.json</td><td>operations</td><td>@oauth2Scope</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@authentication</td><td>This is an alternative way to define that an endpoint either requires authorization or does not require authorization. It can be set to either @authentication Required or @authentication Not required. If it is set to required then you must also set some default scopes that are to be applied via the -authOperationScopes doclet option.</td><td>operations</td><td>@authorization</td></tr>
	<tr><td>@deprecated</td><td>This defines an operation method or a model field/method as deprecated. By default the doclet will not include these in the generated documentation. This behaviour can be overridden by the -disableDeprecated* options described in the doclet options section below. If a deprecated operation is included then the deprecated field of the operation will be set to "true" as per the swagger 1.2 spec.</td><td>operations, model fields & methods.</td><td></td></tr>

## Doclet Options

### Mandatory Options

These are the options that you will always want to set

<table>
	<tr><th>Option</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
	<tr><td>-docBasePath</td><td><p>The base path to the docs in the service.json. You should set to the url of the dir where the swagger json files are hosted e.g. for Carma we use -docBasePath https://api-dev.car.ma/apidoc/ref. If you dont want to build different json files for each server environment one solution which we use at Carma is to use a variable reference for the docBasePath and then serve the json file(s) through a servlet filter which can replace the variable with the hostname of the server it is running on. Alternatively you can use a relative path use the workaround described below (this is technically against the swagger 1.2 spec).</p><p>NOTE: Do not end this with a forward slash.</p>
	<p>NOTE 2: Technically as per the swagger 1.2 spec the doc base path which is in the resource listing file is NOT required, however, if it is not specified the swagger ui will only work if the resource listing file is in one directory and the url in the index.html points to this and the other resource json files are relative to this. This doclet generates the resource listing as a file called service.json and the resource json files are generated in the same directory. You can of course name the files and move them to a structure similar to the swagger petstore example where the resource listing is in at the path /api-docs and the resources are under this such as /api-docs/Users.json or you can use web server rewrites to simulate this structure.</p>
	<p>NOTE 3: For versions of the swagger ui prior to 2.1.0 If you want to use a relative docBasePath then you will need to patch the swagger.js file of the swagger ui to support this. This is because according to the 1.2 spec the docBasePath is supposed to be absolute and earlier versions of the swagger ui did not handle this.</p>
	<p>The patch to apply for relative doc base url is as follows:
<pre>
<code>
SwaggerApi.prototype.buildFromSpec = function(response) {
...
if (response.basePath)
    this.basePath = response.basePath;
  else if (this.url.indexOf('?') > 0)
    this.basePath = this.url.substring(0, this.url.lastIndexOf('?'));
  else
    this.basePath = this.url;
  
  //BEGIN PATCH to support relative base url in the top level resource listing
  if (this.basePath.indexOf('/') == 0) {
    var full = location.protocol+'//'+location.hostname+(location.port ? ':'+location.port: '');
    this.basePath = full + this.basePath
  }
  //END PATCH to support relative base url in the top level resource listing
  ...
  
  
SwaggerApi.prototype.buildFrom1_1Spec = function(response) {
  ...
if (response.basePath)
    this.basePath = response.basePath;
  else if (this.url.indexOf('?') > 0)
    this.basePath = this.url.substring(0, this.url.lastIndexOf('?'));
  else
    this.basePath = this.url;
  
  //BEGIN PATCH to support relative base url in the top level resource listing
  if (this.basePath.indexOf('/') == 0) {
    var full = location.protocol+'//'+location.hostname+(location.port ? ':'+location.port: '');
    this.basePath = full + this.basePath
  }
  //END PATCH to support relative base url in the top level resource listing
  ...
  
</code>
</pre>

	<tr><td>-apiBasePath</td><td><p>The base path to make api calls via Swagger UI, For each API operation the url to that operation is the apiBasePath + the operation Api path. This can be relative if the swagger json files are on the same host as your API. For Carma we use -apiBasePath /carmaapi</p>
	<p>Note: if both the docBasePath and apiBasePath are relative then for versions of the Swagger UI prior to 2.1.0 you will need to patch the swagger.js file of the swagger ui to support this. This is because according to the 1.2 spec the docBasePath is supposed to be absolute. See the docBasePath description above for details of this patch.</p>

Then the variable ${userFieldNamesDesc} would be replaced by the value from the properties file anywhere in the javadoc it was referenced.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-disableCopySwaggerUi or -skipUiFiles</td><td>If set then this does not copy the Swagger UI to the output dir. This can be useful to speed up the doclet and reduce the size of the generated artifact if you either do not use the Swagger UI or host or package it separately.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-swaggerUiPath</td><td>If copying of the Swagger UI is enabled this is the path to the zip file or dir that includes the ui.

Resources without a priorty tag are placed at the bottom. This takes precedence over -sortResourcesByPath. If neither this nor the -sortResourcesByPath options are set then they will be listed in the order encountered by the parser.

This supports a full class name as well as prefixes of the fully qualified class names which means you can enter a package like com.foo to exclude all classes under the com.foo package. This replaces the -typesToTreatAsOpaque option but if that option is specified then those classes will be added to the excludeModelPrefixes set.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-excludeResourcePrefixes</td><td>This allows you to exclude resource classes from the generated documentation. It is a CSV and supports a full class name as well as prefixes of the fully qualified class names which means you can enter a package like com.foo to exclude all classes under the com.foo package.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-includeResourcePrefixes</td><td>This allows you to ONLY include resource classes from the generated documentation that match this. It is a CSV and supports a full class name as well as prefixes of the fully qualified class names which means you can enter a package like com.foo to include only classes under the com.foo package.

To disable this option you can set this parameter which will mean all model fields and getters will generate properties apart from static and transient ones.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-defaultModelFieldsXmlAccessType</td><td>By default the doclet WILL include private fields in generated documentation even if disableModelFieldsXmlAccessType is false. This is because many users expect this behaviour and instead prefer to mark fields to exclude using transient and other javadoc tags. If you DO want default behaviour of fields to be per the JAXB spec e.g. XmlAccessType.PUBLIC_MEMBER then set this flag.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>-modelFieldsNamingConvention</td><td>This is an optional naming convention that can be used for the naming of fields of models. If not specified then the fields of models will have the same name as the java field name unless it has one of the annotations that can override the name such as @XmlAttribute, @XmlElement or @JsonProperty. There are 3 types of naming conventions that can be used instead: lower case, upper case, and lower case with underscore separating words. For each of these they can be used either always or only when there is no name customising annotation/tag (such as @XmlAttribute). The supported values for this field are: LOWER_UNDERSCORE, UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE which always take effect or their equivalents which only apply when there is not customised name for the field are: LOWER_UNDERSCORE_UNLESS_OVERRIDDEN, UPPERCASE_UNLESS_OVERRIDDEN, LOWERCASE_UNLESS_OVERRIDDEN, </td></tr>

## Example

An example project using Dropwizard is included in `swagger-doclet-sample-dropwizard`. To get it running, run the following commands.

```
$ cd swagger-doclet-sample-dropwizard
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/swagger-doclet-sample-dropwizard*.jar server sample.yml
```

The example server should be running on port 7070:

You can view the Swagger UI running here: [http://127.0.0.1:7070/apidocs/](http://127.0.0.1:7070/apidocs/)
NOTE you need to add the trailing forward slash for the CSS to load.

You can also inspect the generated json:

```
$ curl localhost:7070/apidocs/service.json
{
  "swaggerVersion" : "1.2",
  "apiVersion" : "1",
  "basePath" : "http://127.0.0.1:7070/apidocs",
  "apis" : [ {
    "path" : "/Response.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/Recursive.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/person.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/parent.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/ModelResource_modelid.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/HttpServletRequest.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/greetings_name.{format}"
  }, {
    "path" : "/Auth.{format}"
  } ]
}
$
```

## Override Swagger UI

To override the Swagger UI included with the doclet, you can either use your own zip or your own directory and add the swaggerUiPath option to the additionalparam attribute in the pom file.

Here is an example pointing to a zip file:

```
<additionalparam>-apiVersion 1 -docBasePath /apidocs -apiBasePath / -swaggerUiPath ../../../src/main/resources/swagger-ui.zip</additionalparam>
```

Here is an example pointing to a directory:

```
<additionalparam>-apiVersion 1 -docBasePath /apidocs  -apiBasePath / -swaggerUiPath ../../../src/main/resources/swagger-ui/</additionalparam>
```
